#ifndef QUEST_H
#define QUEST_H

// ideas:
// instead of having dedicated questgivers that wait for the player to accept a quest, npcs should define their own goals and objectives
// the idea is that npcs will just try on their own to achieve this goal, and the player can choose to help them
// the npc will just tell the player what they want and it is up to the player to figure out how to achieve that
